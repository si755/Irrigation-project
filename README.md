# Irrigation System Analysis and Optimization
This project was completed during my internship at the Irrigation Research Institute (IRI), Roorkee. The work focused on optimizing irrigation infrastructure efficiency using data collection, GIS analysis, and automation.

## Objectives
- Conduct site surveys and gather accurate irrigation infrastructure data.
- Identify inefficiencies in irrigation systems to improve water usage by 10%.
- Automate reporting pipelines for consistent progress updates.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Geopandas)
- **GIS Analysis:** QGIS, GeoJSON, and Geopandas
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Reporting:** Automated pipelines using Python and Excel integration.

## Key Features
1. Data preprocessing scripts to clean and organize raw survey data.
2. GIS integration to visualize irrigation systems and identify inefficiencies.
3. Automated reporting pipeline to streamline progress reporting.
4. Data modeling for analyzing historical maintenance patterns.

## Results
- Improved water usage efficiency by 10%.
- Reduced spatial data visualization time by 35%.
- Created a data-driven strategy for infrastructure maintenance.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Sample datasets for preprocessing and GIS integration.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, GIS analysis, and automation.
- `visualizations/`: Sample maps and charts.
- `docs/`: Example progress reports and documentation.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IRI-Irrigation-Project.git
